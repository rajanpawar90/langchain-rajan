# String Evaluators

A **string evaluator** is a component within LangChain that assesses the performance of a language model by comparing its generated outputs (predictions) to a reference string or an input. This comparison is a crucial step in the evaluation of language models, providing a measure of the accuracy or quality of the generated text.

In practice, string evaluators are typically used to evaluate a predicted string against a given input, such as a question or a prompt. Often, a reference label or context string is provided to define what a correct or ideal response would look like. These evaluators can be customized to tailor the evaluation process to fit your application's specific requirements.

To create a custom string evaluator, inherit from the `StringEvaluator` class and implement the `_evaluate_strings` method. If you require asynchronous support, also implement the `_aevaluate_strings` method.

## Key Attributes & Methods

- `evaluation_name`: Specifies the name of the evaluation.
- `requires_input`: A boolean attribute that indicates whether the evaluator requires an input string. If set to `True`, the evaluator will raise an error when the input isn't provided. If set to `False`, a warning will be logged if an input is provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation.
- `requires_reference`: A boolean attribute specifying whether the evaluator requires a reference label. If set to `True`, the evaluator will raise an error when the reference isn't provided. If set to `False`, a warning will be logged if a reference is provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation.

## Supported Methods

String evaluators implement the following methods:

- `aevaluate_strings`: Asynchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label.
- `evaluate_strings`: Synchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label.

Below are the available string evaluator implementations and instructions on creating a custom string evaluator.
