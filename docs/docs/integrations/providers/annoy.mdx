# Annoy Vectorstore

Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It also creates large read-only file-based data structures that are mapped into memory so that many processes may share the same data.

## Installation and Setup

To install Annoy, run the following command:



## Vectorstore

To use Annoy as a vectorstore in your application, you can import it as follows:




Here is an example of how to use Annoy to create a vectorstore and search for nearest neighbors:




Note: In the above example, `vector1`, `vector2`, and `vector3` are assumed to be 100-dimensional vectors.
