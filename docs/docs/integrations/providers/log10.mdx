# Log10 Integration with Langchain

This page covers how to use the Log10 library for data management and debugging of Langchain calls.

## What is Log10?

Log10 is an open-source proxiless LLM (Language Learning Model) data management and application development platform that lets you log, debug, and tag your Langchain calls.

## Quick Start

1. Create your free account at [log10.io](https://log10.io)
2. Add the following environment variables:
   - `LOG10_TOKEN` from the Settings tab
   - `LOG10_ORG_ID` from the Organization tab
   - `LOG10_URL=https://log10.io`
   - Your usual LLM API key, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## Enable Log10 for Langchain

To enable Log10 for Langchain, use the `log10_callback` integration as shown below:




## Using Tags with Log10

You can use tags with Log10 to categorize your calls:




## Intermixing Direct OpenAI Calls and Langchain LLM Calls

You can intermix direct OpenAI calls and Langchain calls with Log10:
