# Defining Custom Tools

When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of Tools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components:

- `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent
- `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use
- `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters.

There are multiple ways to define a tool. In this guide, we will walk through how to do for two functions:

1. A made up search function that always returns the string "LangChain"
2. A multiplier function that will multiply two numbers by each other

The biggest difference here is that the first function only requires one input, while the second one requires multiple. Many agents only work with functions that require single inputs, so it's important to know how to work with those. For the most part, defining these custom tools is the same, but there are some differences.

## Import necessary modules




## @tool decorator

This `@tool` decorator is the simplest way to define a custom tool. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function's docstring as the tool's description - so a docstring MUST be provided.




## Subclass BaseTool

You can also explicitly define a custom tool by subclassing the BaseTool class. This provides maximal control over the tool definition, but is a bit more work.




## StructuredTool dataclass

You can also use a `StructuredTool` dataclass. This methods is a mix between the previous two. It's more convenient than inheriting from the BaseTool class, but provides more functionality than just using a decorator.




## Handling Tool Errors

When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly.

When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red.

You can set `handle_tool_error` to `True`, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it's set as a function, the function should take a `ToolException` as a parameter and return a `str` value.

Please note that only raising a `ToolException` won't be effective. You need to first set the `handle_tool_error` of the tool because its default value is `False`.




You can also define a custom way to handle the tool error.
