# Entity

Entity memory remembers given facts about specific entities in a conversation. It extracts information on entities (using an LLM) and builds up its knowledge about that entity over time (also using an LLM).

Let's first walk through using this functionality.








<pre><code>
{'history': "Human: Deven & Sam are working on a hackathon project\nAI:  That sounds like a great project! What kind of project are they working on?",
 'entities': {'Sam': 'Sam is working on a hackathon project with Deven.'}}
</code></pre>









<pre><code>
{'history': [< HumanMessage content='Deven & Sam are working on a hackathon project' additional\_kwargs={} >,
 < AIMessage content=' That sounds like a great project! What kind of project are they working on?' additional\_kwargs={} >],
 'entities': {'Sam': 'Sam is working on a hackathon project with Deven.'}}
</code></pre>

## Using in a chain
Let's now use it in a chain!

## Inspecting the memory store
We can also inspect the memory store directly. In the following examples, we look at it directly, and then go through some examples of adding information and watch how it changes.





<pre><code>
{'Deven': 'Deven is working on a hackathon project with Sam, which they are entering into a hackathon. They are trying to add more complex memory structures to Langchain, including a key-value store for entities mentioned so far in the conversation.',
 'Sam': 'Sam is working on a hackathon project with Deven, trying to add more complex memory structures to Langchain, including a key-value store for entities mentioned so far in the conversation.'}
