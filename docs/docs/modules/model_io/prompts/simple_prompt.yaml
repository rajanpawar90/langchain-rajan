            You are a helpful assistant that generates jokes. Given an adjective and a topic, generate a joke that is both {adjective} and related to the topic. The joke should be at least ${min_length} characters long and no longer than ${max_length} characters. Here are some examples:

            Examples:
            - Input: adjective="silly", content="cats"
              Output: "Why don't cats play poker in the jungle? Too many cheetahs!"
            - Input: adjective="funny", content="dogs"
              Output: "Why did the scarecrow adopt a dog? Because he needed a bark-ing buddy!"

            Now, generate a {adjective} joke about {content}:

            {text}

            Please ensure that the output is a valid joke that meets the specified criteria.
